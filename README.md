# Data-Science-Assessment

### This project is for showing basic understanding of SQL and python.

The project is divided into questions.

- Question 1
  - This is a sequel script that is meant to create a database. I used MySql for the project.
- Question 2
  - In this question I show how to create tables and how to give the columns data types along with defining foreign keys and primary keys
- Question 4
  - This question although odd comes before question 3. I wrote a simple python script that reads excel data, it then connects to my local MySql server then it populates the tables I have created in question two with the data from the excel files
  - For this question to function I used two libraries `pandas` and `mysql`
- Question 3
  - In this question I show how I manipulate the data and how I also join tables

#### To get started in this project

You need to follow the order of the questions. The data I used in this project is also this repository.
